# Introduction
This project, which was part of our second-year computer science end-of-year project, focused on developing a Python API for path finding using the Dijkstra algorithm. The API aimed to determine the optimal trajectory from a starting city to a destination city, while also providing visualizations of the graph before and after the path finding process. It is worth noting that this API implementation represents only a portion of the overall project, which also encompasses the development of a web application for clients and a desktop application for administration purposes.
